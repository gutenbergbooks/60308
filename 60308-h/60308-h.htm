<p>The two addresses which compose this
book were delivered at the Five Years
Meeting of the Society of Friends held in
Indianapolis, Indiana, from October 15th
to 22nd, 1912. They were listened to with
profound interest and appreciation, and
were approved by a Minute which also
ordered their publication, in order that the
wider group of Friends, and all others who
are interested in the message and mission of
a religion of this type, might have the opportunity
to read them. It is a plain duty
of any religious body to put its truths into
circulation, and to reinterpret again and
again the vital principles by which its
members live and work. Here in this little
book will be found in convenient form a
fresh and illuminating expression of the
truths, principles and ideals of present-day
Quakerism and some of the practical problems
confronting the modern world which
the application of these truths, principles

Twentieth Century and that they are

<p class="ctr"><small>BY WILLIAM C. BRAITHWAITE</small></p>


<h3>Introductory Words</h3>

<p>It is with great diffidence that we from
England venture to speak to the American
Yearly Meetings. Our circumstances and
the problems we have to face are often so
different that it would be presumptuous
in us to feel that we had advice on matters
of detail that would deserve very great
attention from you. But when it comes
to our common history and to the common
inheritance we have in the principles and
faith of the Society of Friends, we may
speak freely.</p>

<p>We represent the main body of those
who call themselves “Friends.” The Yearly
Meetings from which we come connect
by continuous history with the first Quaker
Churches of two hundred and fifty years
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ago. Of course when we compare ourselves
as we are now, with the first Friends, we find
great differences, as great undoubtedly
as exist between the New Englander of
to-day and the Pilgrim Fathers. We
should find much to astonish if we could
peep in at one of those first London meetings
held in the summer of the year 1655 at the
Bull and Mouth, the great “tavern-chapel”
in Aldersgate, in which you could then
crowd a thousand people standing. I
fancy these meetings may have been
rather like some of your pioneer meetings
in the West. But the pioneers of the
London work, Howgill and Burrough, would
find modern Quakerism, whether in England
or in the Middle West, a strange thing.
It takes a wise man to recognize his
own great-great-great-great grandchildren.
They have an inheritance that connects
them up with their ancestor, but their
environment is so different that on the
surface they seem to have been changed
into another type of man. At bottom,
however, we shall find that the inherited
type will continue.</p>

<p class="noindent">In other words, the inner life of a religious
movement remains, although the expression
of that life will greatly vary under
changing conditions of time and place.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In order to get at the essentials of Quakerism,
we do well to go back to the beginnings,
to those first years of nascent energy which
carried the Quaker message through the
English-speaking world. Whenever a new
truth starts to life, it is intensely dynamic
and vital; it masters every opposing
circumstance; it flings itself victoriously
against a stubborn world. It is a thing
of life and movement, and I believe it will
be found that a live truth in motion is the
mightiest of all forces. But, a generation
later, unless the vital forces have been
cherished, the emphasis comes to be laid
on establishment rather than movement,
and when a thing gets established it usually
ceases to move; the emphasis comes to
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be laid on dogma instead of truth, on
organization instead of life, and the day of
glory and power passes away. That was
the case with Quakerism.</p>

<p>Two things, I believe, leave a vivid
impression upon any student of the early
Quaker movement. They can be stated
quite simply, but they make up together
the fundamentals of Quakerism to which
everything else belongs as a natural consequence.</p>

<p>In the first place we find ourselves
among men and women of an intense sincerity,
who are seeking truth with all the
energy of their faith, all the energy of their
nature, and, in the second place, we become
aware that this earnest search after the
Kingdom of God and its righteousness was
rewarded with a great finding, a rich
personal experience in their lives, of the
living presence of Jesus Christ, their Savior.</p>

<p>We know now that communities who
called themselves “Seekers” were specially
receptive of the Quaker message, and
became the main strength of the new movement.
In that Puritan age, filled with
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>religious zeal, there were many honest-hearted
men craving after something more
real than the mere outward profession of
religion. They were not satisfied with the
triumphant religion of the time, which
put strong emphasis, and rightly put strong
emphasis, on belief in the great historical
facts of Christianity, but had little or no
conception of Christ’s living presence in
the world to-day. And when Fox told
these honest-hearted Seekers that he knew
in his own experience that Jesus Christ
was come to teach His people Himself,
their souls leapt up to welcome the Divine
Guest. Fox himself was a man of intense
sincerity, who found actually in his own
spirit the place where the seed of Divine
life was springing up, the place where the
voice of a Divine teacher was being uttered,
the place that was being inhabited by a
Divine and glorious presence. He could
tell the great company of Seekers who met
at Firbank Fell in Westmorland on that
memorable afternoon in June, 1652, not
only of an historical Christ, but of a living
Savior, their Teacher to instruct them,
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>their Governor to direct them, their Shepherd
to feed them, their Bishop to oversee
them, their Prophet to open Divine mysteries
to them. I am giving you the points
of his three-hour sermon on that occasion.
Their bodies, he said, were intended to
be temples for Jesus Christ to dwell in.
They were to be brought off from the
temples, tithes, priests and rudiments of
the world. They were to come to the
Spirit of God in themselves and to Christ
the Substance.</p>

<p>The new message opened out a new way
of life to men who were sincere enough
to go through with it and to live it out.
It carried with it a radical transformation
or rather transfiguration of life from the
earthly into the Heavenly. I will give a
passage in the quaint English of the time in
which Edward Burrough, himself one of
these Westmorland Seekers, describes the
experience:</p>

<p>“In all things we found the Light which
we were enlightened withal, and all mankind
(which is Christ), to be alone and only
sufficient to bring to Life and eternal
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>salvation. And so we ceased from the
teachings of all men, and their words,
and their worships and their temples, and
all their baptisms and churches, and we
met together often, and waited upon the
Lord in pure silence, from our own words
and all men’s words, and hearkened to the
voice of the Lord, and felt His word in our
hearts to burn up and beat down all that
was contrary to God, and we obeyed the
Light of Christ in us, and took up the cross
to all earthly glories, crowns and ways,
and denied ourselves, our relations and all
that stood in the way betwixt us and the
Lord, and, while waiting upon the Lord
in silence, as often we did for many hours
together, we received often the pouring
down of the Spirit upon us, and our hearts
were made glad and our tongues loosed
and our mouths opened, and we spake with
new tongues, as the Lord gave us utterance,
and as His Spirit led us, which was poured
down upon us, on sons and daughters,
and the glory of the Father was revealed.
And then began we to sing praises to the
Lord God Almighty and to the Lamb
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>forever, who had redeemed us to God,
and brought us out of the captivity and
bondage of the world, and put an end to sin
and death,—and all this was by and through
and in the Light of Christ within us.”<a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1"
 href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>1<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>Now, it is not my purpose to examine
this experience from the side either of
psychology or dogmatic theology. There
are psychologists and theologians, too,
with whom I could not venture to compare
myself, but it is enough to take
the great experience simply as historical
fact. There can be no question that two
hundred and fifty years ago actual living
intercourse with the Divine, such as Burrough
describes, gathered the first Friends
into their wonderful fellowship. It lifted
them into an order of life which set them
in a place of vision and power and joy.
They saw the things of time in the light
of eternity. They knew what it was to
overcome the world, so that nothing could
daunt their faith. In the words of one of
the finest of the first Friends, William Dewsbury,
the very prisons became palaces
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to them and the bolts and locks jewels.
The Kingdom of Heaven was theirs, not
indeed bringing the prizes of worldly ambition,
but filling life with something richer,
righteousness and peace and joy in the
Holy Ghost. And all this was the reward
and the result of a single-hearted sincerity,—full
righteousness of heart, full humility
of soul, full searching after truth, full
opening of the heart to the incoming of
the Divine life. It had been won, as men
count, at a great price. It had meant a
breach with the current fashions of life and
forms of religion; it had meant a daring following
of fresh truth through all its untried
consequences; it had meant suffering and
loss; it had meant the daily crossing of the
carnal mind. It had meant all these things,
yes, but it had meant also the incoming
of the Life of Christ, bringing men into a
new fellowship with one another and with
God.</p>

<p>We have to admit that in the first tide
of this wonderful experience there were
some serious extravagances of thought and
conduct. It would be strange, I suppose,
<a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>if newly opened eyes did not sometimes
see men as trees walking. You get these
extravagances when a fresh faculty of the
soul is awaking to its powers. But the
main phenomenon of Quakerism is the
heightened personality which undoubtedly
came to the Children of the Light. They
were men and women to “shake their country
in their profession for ten miles round,”
as some of our Friends have done in the
Western states. Their very look carried
with it the sentence of honor or shame.
Their words had a challenging power,
challenging men’s consciences, forcing them
to face the issues of good and evil, shattering
self-complacency and self-righteousness.
The Quaker was an impregnable man,
his principles were held with an extraordinary
tenacity. He stood not on a
sandy foundation of notions, but on a
rock of experience, and thus founded the
man was sure and steadfast. The message
of a present living Christ within the heart
and a present Kingdom of God awaiting
those who would receive it burned in the
heart of these first Friends. It burned
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in their hearts as a gospel for all men.
It is a great mistake to suppose that the
Quaker Church was founded as a sect.
It had nothing sectarian about it. It had
a great message of vital spiritual experience
to give to the whole world. These first
Friends were evangelists of vital Christianity.</p>

<p>They began as our evangelists to-day
begin, by warning men to repent. George
Fox went up Wensleydale calling on men
to repent, for the day of the Lord was at
hand, and proclaiming the Kingdom of
Christ at the door of men’s hearts, for them
to take or reject. That is the spirit of
this early Quakerism, and it surely takes
us back to the spirit of the prophets and of
primitive Christianity.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The centering of life on the realities of
inward intercourse with God is the great
mark of the prophetic and apostolic type
of religion and is in sharp contrast with
religion of the priestly or institutional
type. The prophet was a man who knew
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>what it was to have converse with Jehovah
and sure knowledge of His will. He became
a Seer, a man of insight and foresight,
aware of the true values of things, the true
values as weighed in the balance of the
sanctuary. He became thereby a great
social and moral reformer. His ideal was
of a time when all would be prophets—when
“your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams,
your young men shall see visions.” And
we may remember that this ideal is recognized
on the day of Pentecost as the natural
first-fruits of the Spirit. If it had been
realized the Church would have been a
school of prophets from generation to generation.
Unfortunately the Church has
more often stifled the seer and glorified the
priest.</p>

<p>As I understand it, it is the specific
mission of Quakerism to propagate a Christianity
of this prophetic, apostolic type, a
Christianity in which the Church is a living
fellowship of disciples at work for the social
and moral ends of the Kingdom of God.
But the Church is not simply, in the
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Quaker conception, a fellowship of disciples
at work for the Kingdom of God; it is
such a fellowship <em>plus</em> Jesus Christ Himself,
in whose Spirit, the Spirit which unites
them one to another and to Him, they
become together “one flock, one Shepherd.”</p>

<p>Fellowships, made up of groups of men
and women who are with Christ, redeemed
by Him, learning from Him, following Him,
helping in His work, looking out on life
with something of His devotion to the will
of God and His passion to seek and save
the lost—such are the true Quaker Churches.
It is worth while to analyze the conception
a little. The Church, we say, is a living
fellowship—not in the first place an organization,
but in the first place an organism—not
an institution, but a body, built up of
many cells, many individuals, just as the
body has cells that grow and change and
perform their several functions under the
direction of an all-pervading, all-embracing
life. That is what a living fellowship means.
This life received through direct contact
with the Divine life is the one essential
of the Christian Church. It is the business
<a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the Church to see that it is fostered in
every possible way, so that the body may
freely grow under its influence and freely
express the life in all forms of worthy living.</p>

<p>Historically, Quakerism is the product
of this vital experience and while we
gladly recognize that the experience is
shared by us with many other branches
of the Christian Church, it remains true
that no other religious community so deliberately
and emphatically bases its individual
and corporate life upon this supreme
fact of the soul’s immediate contact with
God.</p>

<p>Our special position among the churches
is sometimes stated—not by the Five Years’
Meeting—in a series of desolating negatives.
We do not practice water baptism, nor
partake of the outward elements of the
Lord’s Supper, we are against war and
oaths and priestcraft, our meetings are held
on a basis of silence, and so on—all negatives.
But we were gathered as a people
out of the world through the force of
dynamic positives. We withstand priestcraft
because every disciple is ordained for
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>service. As George Fox said, every man
hath an office and is serviceable. We
witness against oaths, because we uphold
a single standard of truth speaking, and
against distinctions of dress and address,
because all men are equal in the sight of
God; we oppose war because the armor of
the children of light is the armor of
righteousness, and disuse the outward form
of baptism because the all-important thing
is not the form but the inward repentance
and cleansing by the blood of Christ.
We cannot narrow down the experience of
communion with our Lord to special ceremonials
and places and ministrants, when
we hold that Jesus offers Himself as the
Bread of Life to His people day by day—in
the home, in the factory, at business,
in all our common work and in all our
loftiest worship—the whole of life may be
a sacrament of communion with Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>It is as a “religion of life” that Quakerism
will be presented in the future and is being
presented now.</p>

<p>Its distinguishing note will be its resolve
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to bring all this human life of ours under
the transforming power of spiritual life.
It will stand out against all divisions and
compartments that separate the sacred
from the secular, the sanctuary from the
outward world of nature, the sacrament
from the day’s common work, the clergy
from the laity.</p>

<p>It will tell of a Christian experience that
makes all life sacred and all days holy,
all nature a sanctuary, all work a sacrament,
and gives to every man and woman in the
body fit place and service. Its concern
will be to multiply men and women who will
have a message of power because they are
themselves living in the power of God,
who will spread the light because they are
themselves the children of light. It will
claim the whole of a man’s life, and the
whole of life, individual, social, national,
international, for the dominion of the will
of God.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>So then the question comes: How can
we foster this life? How can the Church
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>continue, through a succession of generations
and amid manifold changes of circumstance
and thought, not merely its
name and organization, its tradition of
the fathers and its orthodoxy of language,
but a living body of Christ, which shall
embody Him, as He would make Himself
known to each age?</p>

<p>That is the supreme question. Unless
the Church does that, it misrepresents its
Lord and hinders the coming of His Kingdom.</p>

<p>Everything must be thought of in terms
of vital relation if we are to see our way
to an answer. We are dealing with life,
and it is life, a unity of life, that connects
the individual Christian with his Savior
and with his fellow-Christians.</p>

<p>I know vital relations are costly things;
it is comparatively easy to preach and
profess; it is not easy to give ourselves.
But vital relations are abundantly fruitful,
and that supreme giving of life which we
associate with the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
is, we know, the most fruitful vital relation
that has ever been exhibited in history.
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“He, the Son of man, gave his life a ransom
for many”—for the whole world.</p>

<p>Dr. Hort has finely said:</p>

<p>“In the times when Christianity owed
nothing to custom and tradition, and when
all the ways of ordinary society tended
to draw men away from it, what drew them
to it and held them to it, despite all persecution,
was the power of its life....
Life calling to life was the one victorious
power which mastered men and women of
all conditions and all grades of culture.”<a name="fn2" id="fn2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2"
 href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>We cannot commend the Kingdom of
God to the world through institutions that
are starched and stiff, but only by the living,
warm, expansive touch of human hearts
reaching out in fellowship to others.</p>

<p>Men substitute tradition for the living
experience of the love of God. They talk
and think as though walking with God was
attained by walking in the footsteps of
men who walked with God. There has
been a great deal of that in the Quaker
Church.</p>

<p>They substitute authority for leadership,
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the authority of the men of the past for the
inspiration of men who have vision and
first-hand experience of truth to-day. They
substitute conventional methods—we have
had a great deal of that, too—for the
natural arrangements which a living fellowship
of disciples would make and modify
from time to time and place to place.
They substitute a cold organization for a
warm fellowship, an outward profession
for an inward experience, priestly agency
for personal responsibility, dogmatic teaching
for education, almsgiving for personal
social service, sectarian ends for the great
purposes of the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>There is no end to the cheap substitutes
offered for the use of the Church. Almost
all of them are methods for running the
Christian Society with the minimum of
spiritual energy, seeing how little spiritual
life you can manage with, whereas our aim
ought to be to generate and use the maximum
in the illimitable service of the Kingdom
of God.</p>

<p>A religion of life must devote itself to
vital processes and vital relations. These
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>are the things that concern our truest
welfare. Take the chief:—loyal discipleship,
inspired leadership, warm fellowship,
loving service, steady spiritual growth;
every one of them vital processes. Look
at them in order just sufficiently to get them
well in mind.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, so far as we know, wrote
nothing, He organized no religious society,
He formulated no creed, but what He did
was to gather around Himself a band of
disciples, men and women, who received
His spirit, and in turn would bring others
into touch with the life which had redeemed
them. His life, springing up in the lives
of men, was to be fundamentally that
which should regenerate the world.</p>

<p>The act of discipleship was following
Jesus. It began with personal adherence
to the Lord, and it continued through
personal communion with Him. In art
and in learning we know how stimulating
the daily contact of teacher and disciple
proves to be—the disciple’s spirit kindled
by the enkindled spirit of his teacher, the
coming together of teacher and scholars
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>into a common life and a common purpose.
That is why the colleges of American
Quakerism have been such great forces.
Still greater, vastly greater, is the discipleship
which is ours in the School of Christ.
It calls for the fullest dedication, the closest
following, the daily taking of the cross,
but it gives us Him who is the Way, the
Truth and the Life.</p>

<p>Discipleship then is the first vital relation
that must be always energizing the Church,
but next in order comes inspired leadership.</p>

<p>The great initial success of Quakerism
was due, beyond all else, so far as human
means went, to the traveling “Publishers
of Truth,” as they called themselves, who
carried their burning message far and wide;
they were like rich life-blood circulating
freely through the body. They were for
the most part men and women of competent
Bible knowledge and religious training,
men with intense sincerity, with a great
experience, who were talking about Christ
because they knew Him. They went out
on a devoted service, which no privations
or persecutions could daunt, and many of
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them were young men in the prime of their
ardor and strength, who would follow the
movings of life rather than the counsels
of prudence—and we want those in the
Church. The Church must be prepared
to take a few risks with its young men.
After all, the hearts of the young are burning
for a crusade.</p>

<p>In the days of persecution which came
upon the Quaker Church there was a great
mortality among these leaders and unfortunately
the supply of new leaders was
small, indeed, ever since that glorious morning
of Quakerism, the equipment of the
Quaker Church with inspired leaders has
been a pressing problem. It is our business
to raise up not priests but prophets, Christian
men and women of trained intelligence
and wide outlook, who know God and have
a sure insight into the great social and
spiritual needs of humanity, whose lives
have been redeemed, whose hearts have
been touched with the live coal from off
the altar. There is no place in vital religion
for the vested interests of a clerical caste,
nor the dead hand of tradition, nor the
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>compulsion of conscience by the authority
of the expert; but there is every need for a
leadership, which continues the past in a
living experience and educates and inspires
and illuminates. A democracy requires
leadership, not the leadership of authority,
but what we may call, to use the constitution
of the Five Years Meeting, an <em>advisory</em>
leadership, moving along channels of inspiration
and personal influence. “For lack of
vision the people perish.”</p>

<p>The third great vital relation that the
Church has to be fostering is warm fellowship.
A few degrees of temperature may
alter a climate and introduce wonderful
possibilities of new life. Change the climate
and you change the kinds of growth which
may come into the world. It is very much
the same with the Church. I remember
a story of a little girl who was taken into a
cold church one winter’s day. She got in
at one end and could scarcely hear what
the preacher was talking about. After
church she went home and her mother
asked her: “Nellie, what was the text
to-day?” She answered, “I couldn’t hear
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it very well, but I think it was ‘Many are
cold but few frozen.’”</p>

<p>I think congregations have sometimes
preached that sermon. It is oftener
preached by the congregation than by the
minister.</p>

<p>Quakerism at times has suffered from a
frigidity of climate which has repressed
and repelled. In the first centuries Christianity
became a great power, because it
was a great brotherhood. Surely we
need to warm up our church organization
so that it becomes quickened into a living
fellowship. We want a Christianity with
the brotherliness left in and the starch
taken out. I remember seeing an advertisement,
“Catlow’s preserves, boiled in silver
pans.” What it meant was this: you got
the sugar, you got the fruit, and you got
nothing else. That is what we want in our
Christianity. We want the sweetness and
we want the fruitfulness. We don’t want
much else. We don’t want frigidity, we
don’t want starch.</p>

<p>Group life with a strong fellowship about
it has always been a Quaker characteristic.
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>In the early days it was groups of Seekers
who embraced the message of Fox, and in
England we still find Friends settled in
groups over the country. I notice, in the
expansion of Quakerism in the far West,
that it is colonies of Friends you get. You
cannot have a diffused Quakerism diffused
over the whole State of Nebraska or California,
but you can have a few groups of
Friends at particular points. But group
life means a great deal more than the
collection of persons within the four walls
of a particular building. It means a life
in community and comradeship, because
the members are joined together actually
and vitally in a common Lord and a common
discipleship. It means, as with the
limbs of the body, that the gifts and
activities of each are freely used for the
service of the whole. It means that each
shares in and contributes to the larger
life of the whole.</p>

<p>Then there is the need for loving service.
A Church is not an end in itself, not a club
where we sit at ease in Zion; it is a means
to an end. It ought to be, in the phrase
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of our early Friends, a “camp of the Lord.”
It needs to have the purposes of the Kingdom
of God ringing in its ears all the time.
It needs to be vowed to the great redemptive
work of seeking and saving the lost.
It will be rightly judged by its output
of service for the Kingdom of God. I
fancy that the weakness of modern Christianity
is very similar to the besetting
weakness of civilization. We grasp our
privileges and shirk our responsibilities.
The healthy Church fixes each member with
personal responsibility for using the life
which he has received. It finds work for
all to do. It knows that activity is the
natural expression of life, and that the
torpor of any part spells atrophy and death.</p>

<p>Last of my list is what I have called
steady, spiritual growth. The vital relations
which are the wealth of the Church
not only bring about a unity of life with
God and with one another, but produce
that progressive development of personality
that we call growth.</p>

<p>These are the questions we need to be
asking ourselves all the time: Are our
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>church members bigger men and women
inwardly than a year ago?</p>

<p>Are they stronger in faith, more radiant
in hope, warmer in love?</p>

<p>Have their spiritual senses developed?
Do they see more of truth, hear more
readily the Divine voice, respond more
quickly to the guidance of the Spirit?</p>

<p>Are their consciences alert, their loins
girt, their hands eager for sacrifice and
service?</p>

<p>Here surely is what we may call the intensive
work of the Church, the making of men
and women not after the pattern of the
world, but after the pattern of Jesus Christ,
who shall go forth in His power and spirit
to serve the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Now, we might well enlarge on these five
important vital processes—discipleship,
leadership, fellowship, service and growth.
But my purpose will have been served if I
have said enough to bring home to you the
fact that these are the things that matter,
the things that are of vital importance in
the Church. Methods and machinery,
organization and Church discipline have a
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>value of their own, but only a subordinate
value to these prime factors of health.
If these lesser things are accepted as a
substitute for the vital factors, the Church
becomes weak. If they are allowed to
limit the development of the life, the
Church may become dwarfed and deadened.
Their true function, the true function of
organization and discipline and these other
matters, is surely large enough—namely,
to provide means with which and through
which the life can readily work.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In vital Quakerism then, the form has
continually to be subordinated to the life.
The life must be allowed free expression
from time to time and place to place according
to the varying needs and circumstances.
In a word, the form must be kept plastic.
This should be as much a fundamental
of religious biology as it is of physiology.</p>

<p>The physiologist tells us that living matter
is always soft and jelly-like. It is matter
in a jelly-like state, permitting of the
free play of molecular interchanges, so that
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it is called a “dynamical state of matter.”
That is the general statement about living
matter which the physiologist has to make
to us to-day. It is essential that it should
be plastic, able to grow, able to change its
shape from time to time. It is always
changing its form, as may be seen in the
colorless cells of the blood. It has been
said, and said truly, that no one of us is
the same person we were seven years ago,
every little bit of us has been changed in
the interval. Living matter does not grow
like the crystal, by the addition of new
matter on its surfaces. It grows by absorbing
matter into its substance and
transforming that into matter like itself.</p>

<p>It should surely be the same in the life
of institutions. The form should be flexible
so that the life may be continually growing
and changing its form according to the
great directing control which the life exerts
upon the body, and you want ease and
flexibility in organizations just as you do
in clothes. If you do not have this, you
will have a good deal of chafing and cramping.
Sometimes, perhaps, a growing boy
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will burst his waistcoat. It is a great
mistake to try to fit the man to the clothes
when we ought to be fitting the clothes to
the man, but it is a mistake that the Quaker
Church has frequently made.</p>

<p>In Church life, our own included, the
letter that killeth has again and again
encroached upon the quickening spirit.
Outward government and external rules
have limited spiritual guidance. The desire
to preserve the deposit of faith has
crystalized vital experience into formularies
and creeds. Emphasis has been
laid upon life according to some stereotyped
standard with a particular cut of
collar and a particular mode of language
and the life of the spirit has been quenched.
But where the Spirit of God has been allowed
freely to work upon the groups of disciples
there has been a wonderful expansion of
Christianity of a vital kind. This has been
largely the case in the great foreign missionary
work of the Churches, and in our
Adult School movement in England, and
in the pioneer work of Quakerism in the
Western states.</p>

<p><a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
If spiritual life is allowed to be the controlling,
directing, molding force in Quakerism
I have no fear for our future. We shall
put in the forefront of our Church work
the things that belong to life, the gathering
of disciples, the raising of leaders and
prophets, the maintenance of warm fellowship,
the encouragement of service, the
fostering of growth. This means that
our Church arrangements will be so made
and modified as to promote and secure the
expression through them of the living
forces which we have at our command.
Those living forces are the spiritual force
of the individual, which we call individual
responsibility, the living force of the group,
which we call fellowship, and above all,
the Divine vitality, the incoming of the
life of Jesus Christ, which we call spiritual
power and spiritual guidance. Church
arrangements, important in themselves,
must be regarded as simply machinery
through which forces can work, and the
more efficiently the machinery allows the
forces to work, the richer will be the service
of the Church.</p>

<p><a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Let us consider the way in which these
great forces get to work. I will take the
meetings of the Church as my illustration.
I am not one who says that the only kind
of Friends’ meeting is a meeting for worship.
I believe that there are three or four types
of Friends’ meetings, in all of which we
may have personal responsibility and group
fellowship and the spiritual power and
guidance of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Take first—it comes first—the evangelistic
service, the meeting which seeks to do
the primary work of the Church, by bringing
the gospel of Jesus Christ to man,
the living gospel of a living Savior. For
such a meeting you want a man who
feels his personal responsibility, who feels
that he is speaking as the ambassador of
Jesus Christ, called, chosen, faithful, with
a freshly given message of truth on his
lips, but you want also behind him to back
him the fellowship and sympathy of a
group of earnest souls, who are helping the
meeting by their prayer and sympathy,
and who perhaps themselves will have some
share in the delivery of the message or in
<a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the other outward service of the meeting.
Moreover, the ingathering of disciples is
a matter not only for evangelistic services,
but for individual personal influence.
Andrew findeth his own brother Simon:
Philip findeth Nathanael. The men and
women reached will need from the first to
be surrounded with a new set of companions
and to be brought into a new fellowship.
They will need, not simply one service
on a Sunday stimulating them to follow
Jesus Christ, but the helpful comradeship
of a group bringing them into a knowledge
of what it means to live according to
the will of God. In the redemptive work
which our Adult Schools in England have
done in hundreds of cases amongst men and
women who had lost their own respect and
were down in the gutter, the most fruitful
work has been done by bringing men and
women a new set of companions, in whose
fellowship they may learn what the love of
Jesus Christ means.</p>

<p>Take next the Friends’ meeting with
worship as its primary object. There
you see clearly the three-fold play of these
<a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>same forces of personal responsibility, group-fellowship
and spiritual guidance. Worship
in fellowship is an intensely active thing.
Its basis is not an inert stillness, but a
waiting upon God in the unity of the spirit.
The meetings of the first Friends were
radiant with the joy of Christ’s indwelling
life. There were times of living fellowship
and communion, warm with the
central fires of Divine love, so delightful
that sometimes they could hardly break
them up and would stay far into the night.</p>

<p>The meeting for worship, more than any
other agency, has given the world the
Quaker type of character—the man or
woman who meets life’s problems simply
and wisely, because he resolves them,
not by passion or prejudice, nor mainly
by the motions of human wisdom or policy,
but by habitually consulting the Light of
God which shines in the waiting soul.</p>

<p>The revival in its power of the Quaker
meeting is an urgent need in the crowded
hurry of this twentieth century, when men
live so much upon the surface and so little
in the deep places of their lives.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In England, wherever you get earnest-hearted
groups of persons together at a
special gathering, as an Adult School week
end, or a lecture school, or a conference,
you find, whether they are Friends or not,
that a Friends’ meeting of a free, open kind,
with prayer and praise and speech and
silent worship all mingled under the guidance
of the Spirit, comes as the great crown
of all our fellowship and our intercourse, the
benediction of all that has taken place,
the perfectly natural means through which
the common fellowship and purpose are
lifted into communion with the life of God.
We hardly sufficiently understand the great
value in deepening character and consolidating
fellowship of meetings of this kind,
where there is a common purpose.</p>

<p>The poverty of many Friends’ meetings
for worship has lain, I think, in the poverty
of common purpose in the congregation.
Where there is a common purpose, a sincere
waiting upon the Lord in fellowship, their
value is very great.</p>

<p><a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It is the place for withdrawing awhile
from the things of outward sense and
exercising the faculties of spiritual sense;
the place where to the awakened soul the
vision of truth may be seen, the Word of
the Lord may be heard, the guidings of
His hand may be felt; the place where the
heart may become aware of its waywardness
and want and may gain strength to
repent and come to Christ and choose the
narrow road of life and dedicated service;
the place where many have been able to
say, with Isaac Penington, “I have met
with my God, I have met with my Savior,
and He hath not been present with me without
His salvation, but I have felt the healings
drop upon my soul from under His
wings.” But it is also the place where the
worship we render and the life we receive
are parts of a fellowship of worship and of
life which comes to the meeting as a whole
and finds its natural expression through
the lips of one and another as the Spirit
touches them to utterance.</p>

<p>There is a third type of meeting, which
we may call a teaching meeting, sometimes
<a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a Bible class and sometimes a service in
which teaching ministry is to the front.
There, again, surely you get the same forces
in operation. The most vital teaching
meetings are those which best combine
inspiration, personal influence and fellowship.
In true educational work the character
and the faculties of a group of scholars
are being trained by vital contact with
one another and with the teacher. The
contact of life with life is going on all the
time. My friend, Rufus M. Jones, is quite
right in saying that the central weakness
of the Friends in the past lay in their failure
to appreciate the importance of the fullest
education of human personality in mind
and soul, and the attention that is now
being given to education in the Society of
Friends is of the highest value. We cannot
overestimate the promise to American
Quakerism and to English Quakerism of
our great educational institutions.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>I have now sought to show that Quakerism
at its best is always the product of
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>vital forces, and is always producing vital
relations. I say “at its best”; that is
the necessary qualification.</p>

<p>This brings me to my last point. What
is needed besides the life of the Spirit, the
life of Jesus Christ in the Church? Surely
what we need is an earnest dedication
on the part of those who are seeking to
know Jesus Christ. God is a spirit, and
they that worship Him must worship in
spirit and truth.</p>

<p>In the early days of Quakerism men were
athirst for the gospel of a living Christ.
In the present day, side by side with much
indifference and indolence there is a wide-spread
craving for reality in religion and life.</p>

<p>Tremendous social problems confront men
to-day, new hopes of higher life are coming
to the mass of workers, new convictions
and new duties are dawning on the world,
and fresh questions are being raised in the
domains of history, psychology and philosophy.
We are probably living in the midst
of as great a period of transition as that
which formed the bridge between the Middle
Ages and Modern Europe, and those alone
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will find the fuller truth and lead men into
it who will bear the travail and follow
the trail of the Seekers of the Light. We
want men who will get on the top of the
situation, men in the spirit of George Fox.
When he was overwhelmed by the confusion
of the year of anarchy that preceded the
Restoration of 1660, he lay in great exercise
of spirit at Reading for ten weeks and he
writes:</p>

<p>“And so when I had travailed with the
witness of God which they had quenched
and gotten through with it and over all
that hypocrisy ... I came to have ease
and the Light shined over all.”<a name="fn3" id="fn3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3"
 href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>It is the duty of the Church to discountenance
all the manifold insincerities which
disfigure our current Christianity, and to
give free scope to honest-hearted love of
truth. Sincerity is a plant that thrives
under freedom and light, but withers under
authority. The Church must use methods
of illumination and education and fellowship
as its means for cherishing true-hearted
allegiance to the Lord. It will find these
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>methods more fruitful than methods of
authority. Methods of authority may
secure an artificial conformity, but it will
always be at some expense of sincerity.</p>

<p>Jesus resolutely turned His back on the
quickly won Kingdom of God, to be made
up of those who gave Him external obedience;
He set Himself to the slow achievement
of an inward Kingdom, which should
gather men into willing discipleship.</p>

<p>I desire an atmosphere of large-hearted
charity and brotherly confidence, which
will allow the Seeker after truth to live in
the power of his experience, even if it is
not a full experience, without being expected
to live beyond his experience, an atmosphere
which will allow him to make use of all
the great aids which we have to-day in the
search after truth—the great aids of scientific
investigation, and what is still more
important, in my opinion, the modern
historical method which we are using to-day.
We want to have as the motto of our Church
the motto of one of our Yorkshire towns,
“Weave truth with trust.” We want a
Church that believes in the nobility of
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the truth; as this belief prevails amongst
us, so shall we find a deeper reality in all
our Church life, and a fresh release of energy
and renewal of inspiration. For Quakerism
is essentially <em>a religion of sincerity, answered
by the incoming of the living Christ</em>.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>What then shall groups of Friends, who
have reached the vital experience of which
I have been speaking, do with their experience?
Surely there are great demands
confronting them to-day, great duties and
convictions to be entered upon, great
Messianic hopes stirring in the world.
This world of change is also a world that is
fertile in the promise of richer life. There
is the passionate craving after truth. Surely
we are to stand for reality in religion and
life. There is the fresh sense that is coming
to men of the meaning and the worth of
personality. Men are learning what the
early Friends reached as a fact of inner
experience, that their hearts could be places
where the Divine side of life could spring
up, and that here in this world of our own
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>personality, in personal responsibility, personal
dedication, personal service, is the
very heart of religion.</p>

<p>There is another Messianic hope:
Woman’s place in the universe in equal
fellowship with man. Surely we can stand
for that. We have expressed that in our
Church life long before it came as a great
hope to the mass of the people.</p>

<p>Then there is the hope of the establishment
of the reign of law instead of brute
force in international affairs. We stand
and have always stood for that.</p>

<p>Again, there is the hope of the better
ordering of society, removing the menace
of destitution from the poor, securing
an equality of opportunity for all, remedying
the conditions that produce stunted lives,
and giving those whom we call men the
chance to become men in reality. The
social regeneration of England and America
has become to-day a living Messianic hope,
making an insistent demand upon the
Christian Church. Surely, with our witness
to the practical application of Christianity
to every part of life, we stand for
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that. Above all, and finally, there is the
great hope of Christ and His Kingdom, not
for a few only but for the whole world.
With our living experience of Jesus Christ,
we must stand for that. Are we not again
called to form a vanguard of progress
towards the Kingdom of God? Our response
to the call depends upon our personal
consecration to the task. Behind the Kingdom
of God as it is, behind the Kingdom
of God as it is to be, there stand the actual
groups of disciples, their personal experience,
their personal devotion.</p>

<p>Joseph Sturge, the founder of the Adult
School movement, once wrote: “It seems
to be the will of Him who is infinite in wisdom,
that light upon great subjects should
first arise and be gradually spread through
the faithfulness of individuals in acting
up to their own convictions.” This personal
witness for truth, based upon a living
experience of it, is the great duty laid upon
each member of the Quaker Church. It
carries with it the necessity for self-sacrifice.
We know how the self-sacrifice of
our Lord on the cross was the atonement of
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the world, and the self-sacrifice of men and
women, in the spirit of Jesus Christ, has
still redemptive force.</p>

<p>We see before the Society of Friends, as
it renews its spiritual communion and its
warmth of fellowship, a great service for
which it has been wonderfully prepared—a
service for the revival of vital, prophetic
religion and for its expression in righteousness
of life—but the service will be fruitful
through discipline and suffering; if it is
to be redemptive of society it will cost
much; those of us who have seen the vision
of the future that may be will find our eyes
filled with light and our hearts with peace,
and our souls will know the springings-up
of everlasting life and power, but at the
same time our feet must be treading the
way of the Cross with our Lord.</p>

<h3>Introductory Words</h3>

<p>After a general introduction I shall
refer briefly to some ways in which Friends
in the past have made a contribution to
the Church’s life and work. I shall then
set forth under seven heads the distinctive
mission which I believe the Society of
Friends has to our own generation both in
Western lands and in the awakening nations
of the East. In closing we may pause to
consider what is required in order that this
message may be believed in its fullness and
power.</p>

<p>During the time that I spent in China as
a missionary, it was my privilege to be
associated with the members of other
Christian bodies who were working alongside
of Friends in the Province of Szechwan.
For a number of years there has been a
large measure of co-operation in the missionary
work in that province, in some
directions of a more thorough character
than in any other part of the mission field.
The province was mapped out thirteen years
ago between the various missions, and by
this means overlapping has been avoided
and great harmony has prevailed. To such
an extent has this been the case that, at
the Conference of West China Missions
held in Chengtu in 1908, the ideal of “One
Protestant Christian Church for West
China” was unanimously adopted by a
gathering representing the missions of six
different denominations, and two inter-denominational
societies. It was also
resolved “that whereas all Christian missions
laboring in West China have for their
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>aim the establishment of the Kingdom of
God, and whereas there is a sincere desire
for more co-operation and a closer union
of our Churches, this Conference recommends
the free interchange of full members
on a recommendation from the Pastor of
the Church from which they come.” This
remarkable action on the part of the West
China Missionary Conference compelled
me to look into the problem suggested by
the title of this address in an altogether
new way. If we were really working for a
single united Church, what was to be the
contribution of our Society: had we in
fact anything distinctive and vital to give,
and in what way were we to give it? The
still more remarkable gathering held at
Edinburgh in 1910, and the contact which I
have since had with members of other
Christian bodies in following up the results
of that Conference, have pressed the question
home with renewed force.</p>

<p>To many it may seem that the ideal
of a single organically united Christian
Church is a wild and impracticable dream.
To some it will appear as an altogether
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>undesirable object to set before ourselves.
We are indeed perpetually reminded in a
variety of ways of the inestimable gain which
comes to the Kingdom of God through the
wide differences of opinion and view-point
represented by the existing sections of the
Christian Church. If union spelt uniformity,
I confess that I should be
found amongst its strongest opponents.
If, indeed, it stood for merging all differences
and an emphasis upon nothing beyond
the minimum upon which we are all agreed,
I could not look forward with any satisfaction
to such a prospect. To me, however,
union stands for something far other. My
ideal of it is represented by the following
sentence from the report presented to the
Edinburgh Conference on this subject:
“They desire that ... those who are
at present separated should seek to be led
by the Spirit of God into a unity in which
all that is true and vital in the principles
and practices of each may be preserved
and reconciled.... Unity when it
comes must be something richer, grander,
more comprehensive than anything which
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>we can see at present. It is something into
which and up to which we must grow,
something of which and for which we must
become worthy. We need to have sufficient
faith in God to believe that He can bring
us to something higher and more Christ-like
than anything to which at present we
see a way.”<a name="fn4" id="fn4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4"
 href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>It is not, however necessary for us to
determine in our own minds what is the
ideal towards which the Christian Church
is moving, or ought to move, in regard to
this particular problem. One thing is
abundantly clear, and that is that, if our
own generation is to receive and respond
to the Christian message, every section of
the Church must bring its best contribution.
No one section will, in itself, contain
the whole of truth. In this day of Foreign
Missions we are enabled to see on the
horizon the glorious ideal of the Kingdom
of God into which each nation and each
race shall contribute its own distinctive
elements of moral strength and spiritual
<a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>illumination. Even so may we not conceive,
as a preparation for this end, the delivery
of a Christian message more comprehensive
than any which has been delivered to the
world since Apostolic days? If this message
is to be delivered, either at home or abroad,
there must be a larger sympathy and a
better understanding between the various
Christian communions. Each must seek
to interpret its own message in terms
intelligible to the others: each must make
a patient endeavor to appreciate the
strength and beauty of that which has
been committed to other Christian communions
with which it has perhaps hitherto
been at war. Whether this will ultimately
lead into an organic unity or not none of
us can possibly say. Whether, indeed, we
should work for organic unity or not will
evoke large divergence of opinion. Whether
or not we should cultivate the spirit of
unity—the atmosphere in which the beautiful
flower of unity will come to perfection—this
is a question upon which there can
surely be no divergence of view.</p>

<p>I approach this question as one who
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dares to believe that Christianity is the
future religion of mankind. I believe this
because I see no other religious system in
the least degree competent to take this
place. I believe it because the closer
linking of mankind by commercial and
intellectual bonds appears to me as nothing
less than a preparation for the linking
together of the whole human race in one
great spiritual kingdom. I believe it
because I see in the Man Christ Jesus the
One who alone can appeal to all ages and
all races and all classes of men: who is
in very truth the Son of Man. I believe
it supremely because I see in Him the only
begotten Son of God sent into the world
for the redemption of mankind, and offering
His life as the one supreme sacrifice for the
sins of the whole world. It is with nothing
short of a passionate longing that I desire
that the Society of Friends may make its
full contribution to the achievement of
this glorious ideal. In the great purposes
of God the full content of truth will, I feel
assured, be some day discovered and followed
by a redeemed humanity. For the
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Society of Friends, which has already played
a great part in leading men into the truth,
I am ambitious that we may not, through
any failure of spiritual perception or moral
earnestness, lose the opportunity of giving
what has been given to us. That which we
have, we hold in trust for the Church and
for the world.</p>

<p>On this occasion, it is not my purpose to
enlarge upon the contribution of our Society
to the <em>world</em>. In common with all the
Christian Churches, we have a great message
to deliver. Even as George Fox said in his
day we are charged primarily with “the
preaching of the Everlasting Gospel.” The
great essentials of this gospel—the Divine
Sonship of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ:
His great sacrifice for sin: His victory over
it in His resurrection: the gift of His Holy
Spirit—these are the things which bind us
together with all sections of the Christian
Church, and which give us, in common
with them, a life-giving message to our
own generation. I wish it to be clear that,
in passing over these fundamental questions,
it is not because I lightly esteem them;
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but simply because I feel so sure that we
here are united with one another and with
all who truly call upon the name of Christ,
and because I wish rather to emphasize
and plead for a more deliberate and sympathetic
attempt to bring the message of
Quakerism to our own generation.</p>

<p>But I do this in no narrow sectarian
spirit. It may be that the following
recollection of a Quaker boyhood represents
to some extent the attitude which many
of us have held at one time in our lives.
“I said ‘thee’ and ‘thy’ to everybody,
and I would fully as soon have used profane
words as have said ‘you’ or ‘yours’ to any
person. I thought only ‘Friends’ went to
heaven, and so I supposed that the use of
‘thee’ and ‘thy’ was one of the main things
that determined whether one would be let
in or not. Nobody ever told me anything
like this and if I had asked anybody at
home about it, I should have had my views
corrected. But for a number of years this
was my settled faith. I pitied the poor
neighbors who would never be let in, and
I wondered why everybody did not ‘join
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the Meeting’ and learn to say ‘thee’ and
‘thy.’ I had one little Gentile friend whom
I could not bear to have ‘lost,’ and I went
faithfully to work and taught him ‘the
language,’ which he always used with me
till he was ten or twelve years old, when the
strain of the world got too heavy upon the
little fellow! I am quite sure no Israelite,
in the days of Israel’s prosperity, ever had
a more certain conviction that he belonged
to a peculiar people whom the Lord had
chosen as His own than I had. There
was for me an absolute break between
‘us’ and anybody else. This Phariseeism
was never taught me nor encouraged
directly by anybody; but I none the less
had it. If I had anything in the world
to glory over, it was that I was a Quaker.”<a name="fn5" id="fn5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5"
 href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>I have no doubt that we shall all wish
to banish from our minds any lingering
suspicion of such a spirit as is represented
by these words. To us it must be clear
that no one sect is the sole repository of
truth, and that others may have more to
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>give than we; but this attitude is not
inconsistent with a clear sense of what <em>is</em>
entrusted to us and an intense desire to
share it with all.</p>

<p>Again I want to make it clear, in referring
to various elements of the Quaker contribution,
that I am well aware that in respect
of many of these questions there are many
individuals belonging to other Christian
denominations who hold the same views
and exemplify in their lives the same moral
qualities. I think, however, that I am right
in saying that in each case Friends hold a
distinctive position through the fact that
they, as an organization, stand for these
views of truth and, in some cases, exhibit
them through that organization in a way
which it is not possible for them to be
exhibited in the lives of single individuals.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>When one looks back upon the past 250
years and attempts to estimate the value
of Friends to the Christian life of England
and America, there are certain outstanding
features which at once arrest attention.
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Amongst the chief contributions which
the Society has been successful in making
hitherto to the Christian life of England and
America are the following:</p>

<p>1. At a time when religion was in danger
of becoming, to a large extent, formal,
ceremonial and external, the early Friends
succeeded in calling the attention of their
own generation to the necessity for a vital,
inward experience. They undoubtedly
helped many besides those who actually
joined with them into a clearer understanding
of the inwardness of the Christian
gospel, and into a personal experience of
the living and indwelling Christ.</p>

<p>2. The Reformation and post-Reformation
period was marked by that intensity
of religious conviction which so often leads
to intolerance and religious bigotry. Even
those who had suffered persecution themselves
followed the very example one would
have expected them to avoid as soon as
the opportunity occurred. That our spiritual
forefathers had an immense influence
upon that age, in bringing about a greater
spirit of religious toleration, cannot be
<a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>doubted by any who read carefully the
religious history of that time.</p>

<p>3. From the day that William Penn
entered into treaty with the Red Indian
Chiefs till the day when John Woolman
made his protest against Negro Slavery,
and on till John Greenleaf Whittier thrilled
the nation with the songs which called to
love and brotherhood, Friends have consistently
stood for an attitude of sympathetic
understanding of other races. Nowhere
perhaps has this been more publicly
and more deservedly acknowledged than
by the action of President Grant in handing
over to Friends the management of certain
reservations for Red Indians, a policy
which he declared had proved “most satisfactory.”</p>

<p>4. Even at the time when Quakerism
ceased to be a powerful evangelical force,
and when Friends seem to have lost something
of their first love, the Society was
producing men and women of outstanding
Christian character, who were known to
be no hypocrites; whose word was their
bond; whose business integrity was proverbial
<a name="png.068" id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and whose character for truthfulness
and honesty was surely an outstanding
contribution to the Christian life of the
eighteenth century. This type of character
has, I believe, been largely maintained
till the present day.</p>

<p>5. And lastly, scarcely any great philanthropic
movement has risen during the last
200 years which has not had the support
of Friends; and notable cases could be
quoted to show the way in which Friends
have taken the lead in such matters. Especially
at times when religious revival has
taken on emotional forms, and when the
emphasis has been thrown almost exclusively
upon the subjective side, it has been
of great benefit to the Church to have
the association of practical philanthropy
with the very Society which has always
insisted on the necessity for an inward
experience.</p>

<p>I refer to these few historic examples
in order to illustrate the way in which I
am approaching the question, and to show
how a particular Christian Society has,
for upwards of 250 years, been steadily
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bringing its influence to bear upon the
Christian life of two great nations. In
looking back upon the past, we may truly
thank God and take courage. Let there
be no thought of arrogance in our minds;
but rather of deep humility, as we proceed
to look into the problems which confront
us to-day, and consider in what direction
our Society may contribute towards their
solution.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In whatever direction we look to-day,
we see the danger of an invading materialism.
By this I do not mean any philosophic
position. In fact, I do not believe that
what might be called philosophic materialism
is gaining ground at the present time.
It does seem to me, however, that a practical
agnosticism is making itself felt in
very many quarters. The vague sense that
God is responsible for the Universe, that
at one time some great Cause operated to
bring it all into being and that, in some
way, we are all still depending upon the
benevolent activity of that Cause, is not
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Christianity. The Christian Church is
being invaded by this uncertainty with
regard to God. There is a loosening, it
seems to me, of that close grip upon the
eternal verities which enables men perpetually
to draw upon the resources of God,
to throw themselves in the abandonment of
faith upon a living Savior and to find that
faith justified at every step of the way.
Men do not like to set forth upon a path
without knowing whither it leads. The
prevailing scientific temper leads men to
test everything many times, to trust nothing
beyond the range of verifiable scientific
facts. This breeds a spirit which only takes
cognizance of the things which can be seen
and felt and weighed and measured. Where
is there room in this narrowed universe for
the limitless activity of the God of Love?</p>

<p>When we turn our eyes to the non-Christian
world, the danger becomes more
startlingly apparent. Here are the “child
races” filled with that sense of the mystery
and awe which the little child, even in our
materialistic modern world, still has. The
savage thinks of God as infinitely near,
<a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or at least he thinks that the spirits of the
departed are. It needs no carefully stated
argument to demonstrate the existence of
an unknown world. It lies all about and
around. He is reminded of it by the thunder
and the lightning. And to him there
comes our modern education explaining
away all the beautiful or the dreadful
mystery of life, and, before he knows what
has happened, he is losing his sense of God.
The old sanctions are loosened as the old
fear is removed, and he has got helplessly
adrift into the mid-stream of a barren
rationalism.</p>

<p>What are we to do for him and what are
we to do for the modern man in our midst?
We shall not have to go very far to search
for those who still find the remedy in an
elaborate and beautiful religious ceremonial;
who will tell us that it is foolish to build our
religious conviction upon mere personal
experience: that we are rather to turn back
to the experience of the Christian Church.
We are to observe its ordinances perfectly.
There are to be stated seasons of prayer:
there are to be stated means of grace:
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and through these, whether you <em>feel</em> any
better for it or not, you will be brought
into line with the experience of the Catholic
Church and become partakers of Heavenly
grace. I am far from denying that beautiful
forms of worship, that stated seasons of
prayer, or that time-honored ritual may
have a real place in the spiritual experience
of very many. Doubtless, these things
have been of value in bringing numbers of
souls into the Kingdom of God, and will
still be so. To me it seems, however,
that they are fraught with great danger.
Especially at the present time, when men
intensely desire reality, they are apt to
become impatient with the forms of a
bygone age, however zealously they may
be followed by some of their contemporaries.
And, on the other hand, there are
those who are too readily content with the
outward and allow the mere forms of
religion to salve the uneasy conscience.
Was there, I wonder, ever a time when
men needed more than they do to-day a
clear summons into a life of spiritual reality
and of personal intimate knowledge of God?
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Can we summon them back as did our
forefathers? Have we the message that
they had? Can we say, as did Francis
Howgill, “The Lord appeared daily to us
to our astonishment, amazement and great
admiration, insomuch that we often said
one to another with great joy of heart,
‘What! Is the Kingdom of God come to
be with men?’” The message sent forth
by the Edinburgh Conference to the whole
Church of Christ called her to realize that
“God is demanding of us all a new order
of life ... that He is greater, more
loving, nearer and more available for our
help and comfort than any man has
dreamed.” If there was one thing which
the Society of Friends was called into
existence to proclaim, it was this very truth.
Are we proclaiming it to-day? And, for
the non-Christian world, how great is the
danger of substituting one set of ceremonies
for another. To those who have been in the
habit of trusting to such barren rites as the
burning of paper money, the washing in
the Ganges and the sacred but often most
unholy feasts, how easy it is to allow the
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>burning of incense or the rites of Baptism
or the Holy Communion to take the same
place in their thoughts and to be trusted
for salvation or merit in the same way.
In fact, one of our own missionaries in
Ceylon was a man who had, for some
years, worked in connection with another
Society, and who had found that he was in
constant difficulty because he was building
up with one hand what he had to remove
with the other. He came to the conclusion
that, if he was to help men into a personal
experience of Christ, he must take away
entirely all possibility of trusting to outward
rites, and preach to them the simple
Quaker message. When the Friend missionaries
in China met after the West China
Conference to consider the way in which
we might express in a few words the
contribution of Friends towards the doctrine
and practice of a Union Church, they
drew up a brief statement which contains
the following words under the heading of
“sacraments.” These words are intended
to convey the essence of the Quaker position
on this point.</p>

<p><a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
1. “The Pre-eminence of the Spiritual
Experience.</p>

<p>2. “The Spiritual Experience may be
realized independently of any special occasion,
rite, or mediating person, except our
Lord.</p>

<p>3. “Membership of the Church of Christ
is of such a character that any outward
recognition fails adequately to determine
it.”</p>

<p>If the complete Christian message is
to be given, if the Christian Church is to
enter fully into an understanding of the
mind of the Master, this aspect of truth
needs to be emphasized, not only by words
but by lives, and not only by the lives of
individuals but by that added emphasis
which comes through the existence of a
corporate Body, whose very existence
depends upon the validity of this tremendous
fact. Our position as a Society does
depend upon this truth, and out of it grow
many other of our special contributions,
if not all. We are set in the world of to-day
to testify to a truth the enunciation of
which has never been more urgently or
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>more widely needed. The whole Church
of Christ should be sounding forth this
message. <em>She needs, therefore, a body of
persons who stand for the principle that God
deals directly with every soul of man, ever
challenging the spirit of man to rest in nothing
short of direct personal intercourse with
God.</em></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>No one can be blind to the way in which
every detail of our life is being modified
by the many new inventions which accelerate
the rate of living. We crowd into a
single day more than our forefathers could
put into a week. The express train, the
telegraph and the telephone, the typewriter,
the multiplied devices for saving
time—all these things are speeding up
life to the point at which the time for
meditation and quiet is crowded out. This
is surely a great and growing danger of
which none of us is wholly unconscious.</p>

<p>I have been surprised to find in how many
different circles there is at the present
time a feeling of dissatisfaction with the
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>forms of worship which have for long been
regarded as sufficiently satisfactory. I
know a number of cases where, in high
church circles, prominent people are feeling
after something more akin to a Quaker
Meeting than anything else. I am also
intimately associated with some of the most
living movements in my own country,
in which meetings have been held on the
same lines. This does not mean that
great value does not still attach to regular
arranged services. No doubt the vast
majority of those who attend the services
of the Anglican Church are still finding
out that their spiritual needs are met
thereby; but, there are others, and some
of them are choice spirits, who feel the
need of more liberty and who crave for
more stillness in their worship. They are
coming to recognize the great danger of
the regular pre-arranged service such as is
usual in most other denominations. They
fear, perhaps, the invasion of the sanctuary
by the spirit of rush and hurry.</p>

<p>Turning to the mission field, I could
quote many examples which show the way
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in which the Quaker form of worship
appeals to some of those who are being
brought out of heathenism. I think of
one young man, a close personal friend of
my own in China, who, having attended
one or two Friends’ Meetings, came to us
and urged us, at a very early stage in our
mission work in Chengtu, to establish a
regular Friends’ Meeting in addition to
the ordinary mission services; and I recall
with keen satisfaction the experiment which
we made and the true worship into which
Chinese and English together entered and
the helpful and inspired ministry which
arose out of it. A leading Indian Christian,
describing the establishment of the National
Missionary Society of India, explained to
a Friend the way in which the Christians
had met together for united worship,
sitting as he said often as much as half an
hour in silence and then breaking out, as
prompted by the Spirit, into prayer and
praise. “We,” he said, “find this most
helpful; it means a great deal to us, and
we have meetings of this kind before every
one of our business sessions; but,” he
<a name="png.079" id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>continued, “you won’t be able to understand
it; it is so different from your English
ways.” You can imagine his surprise on
being told that he had almost exactly
described the way in which the Friend to
whom he was speaking habitually worshiped.
Not long ago I took a friend of
mine to Meeting. He was a man who had
spent some years in India and had become
intimately associated with a number of
Indian students. After Meeting he asked
me if our Meetings were open to the public;
because, if so, he would like to bring some of
his Indian friends to Meeting, as he felt
it was exactly the thing which would help
them.</p>

<p>It seems to me that, in the forms of
worship in other Churches, we have either
on the one hand a united act of worship
which is to some extent formal, as
when the congregation joins in the singing
of a hymn or in a set prayer; or
else on the other hand we have an
individual act which is not formal but
inspired, as when a man filled with a message
from God delivers it to the congregation.
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I know no other form of worship
which fulfils my idea of a <em>united act inspired
of God</em>. As we wait together upon Him
we are together called into His Holy presence.
The silence represents to us not
merely the touch of each individual spirit
with the Spirit of God; it represents rather
the uniting of our spirits together in harmony
with His Spirit. Thus are we privileged
to understand something of that true
Communion of the Saints which is to be
fully experienced in the life beyond. A
Friends’ Meeting filled with the sense of
the presence of God is, to my mind, one of
the chief contributions which Friends ought
to be making to the life of the Church of
Christ. This ideal was well expressed by
T. R. Glover in the Swarthmore Lecture.</p>

<p>“When it is real worship, common worship
may take the individual soul a good
deal further than it may go alone. We make
the atmosphere for one another—courage,
depression, hope, study, reflection or whatever
it may be; and faith is, as a matter
of fact, as liable to be helped as hindered
by environment. Prayer, when it is reality,
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and when it is the common activity in one
place at one time of a community of like
experience, may reach a higher plane than
we have known before, not as a matter of
mere emotion but with results that do not
pass away.</p>

<p>“Love is reinforced by this solidarity
of the Christian communion, for in it
Christ becomes more real, and things are
apt to be seen here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub specie aeternitatis</i>
in their true proportions. Such vision of
reality will over and over again be translated
into action and consecration. The
common worship, if it is the act of all, and
done in deep seriousness, passes out of the
formal into the effective, with or without
mystical rite or element, it becomes communion,
and we understand in a new and
quieter way what the early Church meant
by its doctrine of the Holy Spirit. God’s
Spirit is not bound by our choosing, but it
is possible for us to become more receptive.
It is easy to see how men have come to the
view that through the Church the gift of
the Spirit is mediated.”<a name="fn6" id="fn6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6"

He has to add however, “It is, I think,
right to say here that these paragraphs
are an epitome of my observations and
experience of the Student Christian Movement;”
a statement which may well suggest
to us in England that our Meetings
have not been all they might have been in
recent years. Although I do not consider
the following statement as satisfactory as
that previously quoted from the same
source, I should like again to refer to the
statement drawn up by the members of
the Friends’ Mission in West China.</p>

<p>“1. United worship should provide
opportunities for the Spirit of God to deal
individually with each worshiper as well
as for each worshiper to approach to God
in the way best suited to his individuality.</p>

<p>“2. Each individual has a ministry for
the benefit of all, to be exercised in spirit,
and the true worship of believers depends
upon the faithfulness of each.</p>

<p>“3. Worship should provide an opportunity
for this ministry to assume vocal
form, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
who may thus use any worshiper.”</p>

<p><a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span

I recently received a letter from one of
the most prominent religious leaders in this
country in which he said: “This morning
I attended the Old Friends’ Meeting here
in Philadelphia and was much refreshed in
spirit. I believe we must have more of the
spirit of the Friends if we are to save
North American Christianity.”</p>

<p>If meetings such as these have a real and
timely message to-day, it becomes us to
see that we do not lower our ideal and
that we strive to achieve it more nearly in
every meeting we hold. <em>For the Church
needs a quiet place in which its members
can together hear God’s voice and find afresh
the message and the power to believe it. It
needs to learn how to wait upon God.</em></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>One of the most notable features of the
last century has been the progress of the
democratic movement. Every one who
has watched that movement must realize
the great danger of the tyranny of majorities.
It is true that this danger seems to
most of us to-day a smaller one than the
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>danger of the tyranny of a bureaucracy
or of an autocrat. But, whichever way
we look at it, it does not seem that we have
found the true solution. Is it not possible
that the pendulum has swung too far and
that we have yet to discover the highest
principle upon which a State may be
governed?</p>

<p>In the new democracies of the East there
is perhaps a greater danger, owing to the
rapidity with which the new ideas have
spread and the lack of an understanding
of the deeper principles out of which they
spring. Those who have closely followed
affairs in the Far East will realize with
what anxious eyes Japan has been watching
the democratic movement in China, and
how she would have given almost anything
to preserve at least the name of monarchy
for China. In India and in other nations
the desire for an independent government
and the rule of the people is outrunning
the growth in ability to fulfil such functions.
The spread of democracy and the desire
for national independence is making itself
felt, not only in the State but also in the
<a name="png.085" id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>young Churches in the Far East. On the
one hand we have those systems of Church
Government which are classed together as
Episcopal, and in which the authority is
vested in a comparatively few. On the
other hand we have Churches which pin
their faith to the old adage “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi
vox Dei</i>.”</p>

<p>I question whether either has found the
solution to the difficulty of the young
Church. In both systems there lurk dangers
which can here only be hinted at.</p>

<p>It has often seemed to me that Friends
do not realize how much they have in
their Meetings for Discipline. I believe
that we have here a most valuable contribution
towards the solution of the difficulty
at which I have hinted. We have at least
an ideal which we ought to be most careful
not to surrender. Let me explain a little
more fully what I mean.</p>

<p>We meet together on the assumption that
Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church and
that we can trust Him to lead it. We
enter upon the discussion of a difficult
matter of business with the full knowledge
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that many different shades of opinion will
be represented in that meeting. Nevertheless,
we discuss it with the confidence
that the will of God will be made known
to us as a Body of persons, and through the
whole Body; not that is to say merely
through the individual or set of individuals
who act as a Cabinet, nor even through the
majority of those present. We discuss the
question together and we believe that, at
the end of that discussion, we shall be led
to a united judgment as to the wisdom of
a certain course of action. That judgment
may not be the opinion of any one individual
in the room. It may be the opinion of the
actual minority of those present; but, if
we are in a true Friends’ Meeting for
Discipline, we come out of that room all of
us satisfied that the Spirit of God has
Himself determined our action and that
He has, as it were, made Himself responsible
for it. If we entered our Meetings
for Discipline in this spirit, they would
assuredly be a sacrament to every one of
us. There is need for as much consecration
of heart in them as in the Meeting
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for Worship; and perhaps more, for it is
not easy to give up one’s own pet theories
and prejudices. If this call to sacrifice
is cheerfully accepted, our Meetings for
Discipline should be of untold blessing to
each of us; and thus there would be a chance
for us to do our part in the solution of this
most difficult problem. The end towards
which we are working is the Kingdom of
God—neither a democracy nor bureaucracy,
but a theocracy. Here again I am encouraged
by noticing in some movements
with which I have been connected in recent
years, a tendency to follow in certain lines
the methods which Friends have adopted in
their Meetings for Discipline. I refer
especially to certain Missionary Conferences
and Committees with which I am connected,
and to my experience in the Student
Christian Movement of Great Britain and
Ireland. And to apply this more particularly
to the conditions in the mission field
at the present time: in every mission we
find this restless desire for autonomy.
If we truly believe that the Spirit of Christ
is present in the Church itself, surely there
<a name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>need be no fear in our standing aside as
foreigners and leaving the Church to Him
who has been the Founder of it and who is
Himself responsible for its future. If,
on the other hand, we leave only the ideal
of government by certain Bishops specially
chosen, or by a majority which can perhaps
be maneuvred in the interests of a particular
person or opinion, we shall indeed have
grave cause to fear for the Church as it
is left to itself.</p>

<p>To those not accustomed to such procedure
this seems, no doubt, like a wild
impossibility. To Friends it is a serious
truth and the experience of this one Christian
body has demonstrated, amid much
failure at times, its entire practicability
as a method of transacting business.
Whether or no this method be adopted by
wider circles, it is nevertheless true that
<em>the Church needs a deeper conviction of the
active presence of God “in the midst of
her,” not merely to inspire the individual
but also to direct the counsels of the body as
a whole</em>.</p>


<h3 title="VI.">VI.<a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></h3>


<p>Next to the danger of materialism or
practical agnosticism in the Church of
Christ comes perhaps the danger of opportunism.
I suppose to the end of time there
will be difference of opinion on the question
of compromise. That a certain element of
compromise must come into human life,
as it is now arranged, seems to me inevitable.
Much as we chafe against it, we are bound
to accept it, owing to the limitations of
our existence here. To take one of many
examples: I suppose there is no one of us
who does not year by year contribute,
through the payment of taxes either direct
or indirect, to the maintenance of the Army
and the Navy, and perhaps to other actions
on the part of the State with which he
equally disapproves. There is, however, a
whole range of problems upon which opinions
differ very greatly. The question
to which I have made allusion—the question
of Peace—illustrates my meaning perhaps
as well as any. At what point are we
going to make our Peace principles felt?
<a name="png.090" id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>There are certain fundamental propositions
to which every member of the Church
of Christ can be found to assent. That
we should love our enemies: that we should
do good to those that hate us: that we
should show kindness to all men: and so
forth. But at what point are you going
to apply these principles? We are living
in a world where some kind of physical
force seems to be absolutely necessary.
I doubt if there are any of us who would
go as far as Tolstoi in our rejection of it.</p>

<p>But does this mean that we must therefore
accept war as a necessity of this present
evil time, and therefore be prepared ourselves
to take up arms, as many of our
fellow-Christians think? The “practical
commonsense man” sees no other course,
even if his conscience do cry out at times.</p>

<p>To take another of the great problems
which press upon us in these days, viz:
the relation of Christianity to business.
“Business is business” too often means
that Christian principles cannot be applied
to it. There are so many things a man
“must do” if he is to get along at all.
<a name="png.091" id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“It is better to leave religion out altogether
in some of these practical affairs.” In
non-Christian countries we constantly see
the divorce of ethics from religion; and
I am afraid the evil is not confined to distant
lands. We all know something of
the pulpit that dare not denounce the sins
practiced by the wealthiest of the congregation:
the minister whose tongue is tied
upon sweating and overcrowding: the
church-member who is zealous in the observance
of religion, but lacking in his business
obligations.</p>

<p>What a need for the thoroughgoing
Christian who has ideals and maintains
them in everyday life, who will not lower
them to suit the exigencies of life, or the
pressure of social custom, to whom expediency
is a forbidden word even though
its exclusion may mean the Cross!</p>

<p>Or turn to the great non-Christian world
with which we are daily brought into contact.
Here is one of the greatest problems,
if not the greatest, which confronts our
civilization to-day. How are we going to
meet our fellow-men of other races? The
<a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>politician has his solution: the commercial
man has his. What is to be the solution
of the citizen of the Kingdom of God?
There can only be one answer: we must
go to these men as to those who are our
brethren; we must see them not as wholly
bad or depraved, but as those who have in
them infinite potentialities, who are called
into the same citizenship and the same sonship
which we enjoy. We must reaffirm
to-day our belief in that Light which lighteth
every man, but we dare not be content at
that. As our forefathers led the way in
the understanding of sympathy with other
races; so we to whom these still more
intricate problems present themselves, must
stand for the ideal, however hard it seems—the
ideal of spiritual kinship and the strenuous
effort to realize it in our relationship
with other races; and so it comes about
that the Foreign Missionary enterprise
seems to be of the very essence of Quakerism,
and that we find it closely akin to the
great causes of Peace and Anti-slavery
with which our Society has ever been
identified. Is the Church of Christ playing
<a name="png.093" id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the part which it ought to play in regard
to these matters? Is it taking the stand
which it ought to take in regard to the
color problem in this country, in regard
to the export of spirituous liquors, and so
forth? What, indeed, is to be our view of a
Christian Mission College which deliberately
includes in its curriculum military
drill with the full paraphernalia of warfare,
and this in the traditionally peace-loving
empire of China? To me it seems evident
that there is a great place for the Society
of Friends in this movement, just because
we stand upon the side of idealism in all
these complicated issues.</p>

<p>Right along the line Quakerism ranks
itself on this side. The Society of Friends,
as I read its history, has stood for an
idealism which is well in advance of the
current practice. In the holding of our
Meetings for Worship we have stood
for the absolute ideal; many of our
Christian brethren admit it in theory, but
regard it as quite outside the sphere of
practical religion. The same seems to be
true as regards the Sacraments, Oaths, and
<a name="png.094" id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>so forth. The idealist is needed as much
to-day as ever he was. The moral reforms,
to the achievement of which Friends have
contributed so much, have been attained
by men who dared to be regarded as
utterly impracticable, as mere dreamers
and visionaries. When slavery, for example,
was knit into the very fabric of
Society, when its abolition seemed certain
to lead to an industrial cataclysm, Friends
were not wanting who boldly said, “Whatever
happens, we must liberate the slave;”
and in the end the visionary was right and
the practical common-sense man was wrong;
and the simple secret of it all was that the
visionary saw God first and his fellow-men
in the light of God’s will for them.</p>

<p>No less has it been true in business
affairs that Friends have maintained the
strictest standard of integrity in the face of
opposition and probable loss. They recognized
a higher obligation which must be
obeyed whatever the consequence which
faced them. And in the strength of that
idealism they won their way to the respect
and confidence of their fellows. In the end
<a name="png.095" id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they were often found to be the more
practical in spite of (or was it because of?)
<em>their unreasoning idealism</em>. “It was in
this focussing upon moral effort that the
Quakers differed most from the other sects
of the Commonwealth period. Their
‘views’ were not novel or original. Every<!-- TN: original has hyphen but quoted source doesn't --> one
of their peculiar views had already
been proclaimed by some individual or by
some religious party. What was new was
the fixing of their ideas into one living truth,
which was henceforth <em>to be done</em>, was to
be put into life and made to march.”<a name="fn7" id="fn7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7"
 href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>And to-day, if the Society is true to its
past it will not lose the chance of standing
on the same side for the ideal, the Christian
and the only final solution of these
complex problems. The <em>Church needs a
body of men and women who will dare to be
fools, unpractical, dreamers, in following
the Light and who will act up to their ideals.</em></p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Another outstanding feature of to-day,
to which the Society of Friends ought to
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have a special relation, is that which is
spoken of as the Women’s Movement.
This undoubtedly expresses much more
than a political or social aspiration. It
corresponds in some measure to the democratic
movement and indicates the stirring
of spiritual aspirations. Its symptoms are
seen not only in the movement for women’s
suffrage, and not only in Western countries.
A recent book, published by the wife of
one of the ruling chiefs of India, is symptomatic
of great changes that are taking
place all over the East. The book is a
statement of the positions which are open
to women in Western countries, and an
urgent plea for the opening of these doors
to the women of the East also. Although
lacking in the realization of the difficulty
of suddenly making so great a change in
India, the book is well worthy of notice
as indicating the stirrings of a new life
among Indian women. Hardly any contrast
could be imagined greater than their
condition in the past and that which is
sketched out for them in the future by the
authoress of this book. Probably many
<a name="png.097" id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will have noticed that an incident in the
deliberations of the Provisional National
Convention of China at Nanking was the
presentation of a petition from the women
of that country for the granting of women’s
suffrage.</p>

<p>I was recently made vividly aware of the
vast difference between the practice of
Friends and that of other Christian denominations
by the consideration of a report
on the relations between men and women in
the mission field, which was presented
to a representative Missionary Conference
in Great Britain last summer. The report
urged that an equal share in the management
of mission affairs should be given to
women, and brought forward a strong
array of reasons in favor thereof. It was
referred to by a member of one of the
largest missionary societies as “a momentous
report.” A lady Friend described it
as “daring incursions into the obvious.”
The fact is that we as Friends possess the
very thing which some other Churches are
beginning to realize they need. A brilliant
writer and prominent Free Church leader
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in Great Britain has recently asked the
question why, in these days of the higher
education of women, should the ministry
be a monopoly of the men; and we Friends
echo, with the thought of Elizabeth Fry
and Hannah Chapman Backhouse and many
another in our minds, “Why, indeed!”
To the spiritual insight and courage of our
forefathers we owe it, that in the Society
of Friends we can say “There is neither
male nor female.” I wonder if we sufficiently
realize how great an heritage this
is—how sacred a trust; and if we take
sufficient pains to bring our message in
this respect to the notice of others. If
the women’s movement, with all its great
possibilities, is to be a contribution, as
it ought to be, to the building up of the
Kingdom of God, the Churches need to
adopt a sympathetic attitude towards it,
and to express in their own organizations
their readiness to adapt themselves to meet
its ideals. If they are to do this with
confidence, what greater stimulus could
they have than the knowledge, which few
outside our borders possess, I fear, of the
<a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>uniform experience of our Society throughout
its history? <em>The Church needs to
realize with greater vividness how much the
consecrated womanhood in her midst can
contribute to her life, and to give women the
fullest opportunity to make that contribution.</em></p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>If the women’s movement expresses,
as it undoubtedly does, a spiritual aspiration,
I think the same may be said with
perhaps equal force of the labor movements
in Western countries. That many working-men
have been practically unable to develop
the higher side of their nature, on account
of the conditions of labor, is generally
admitted. The movement for higher wages
and better conditions of work is, after all,
something more than the expression of a
grievance against capital. There is the
deep yearning for a fuller life. This great
aspiration the Churches should recognize
and seek to meet. Speaking for my own
country, I can say that one of the great
obstacles with which the Churches are
confronted in dealing with the working-men
<a name="png.100" id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is the suspicion of the mercenary
spirit. To the workingman, the clergyman
is paid to do a certain job and must justify
his existence. Of course this is a prejudice
which is soon removed when the man gets
into such personal relations with the minister
as to feel the heartbeat of a true friendship,
but often these personal relationships
are hindered through the prejudice referred
to. Do not these facts suggest that there
is a need for one section of the Church
which has not this disability and whose
ministers are all laymen?</p>

<p>And this brings me to the further thought
of the need for this very testimony on the
mission field to-day. The other day in
India a missionary of another Society said
to me, “Whatever you Friends do, do not
give up your principles in regard to a free
ministry,” and he proceeded to quote to
me a case of some well-to-do young men
whose mother was an earnest Christian
woman. She, it appeared, had been urged
to take up regular Christian work, and
they had constantly stood in the way.
When pressed as to the reason for such
<a name="png.101" id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>action, they informed the missionary that
they could not allow their mother to take
up Christian work because the neighbors
would at once say that they could not afford
to keep her; so intimately were the ideas
of Christian work and the payment of a
salary connected in the minds of the
Indians. How often do we hear the gibe
flung at Christian Missions that their
converts are all “rice Christians!” The
element of truth in the slander of course
is this—that so many of the best are called
to direct religious work for which they
receive regular payment. At a conference
of leading Christians held recently, a strong
representation was made to the foreigners
present, and through them to the home
boards, to the effect that missionaries
should lay greater emphasis on the calling
of Christians into business life and cease
to so state the problem of Christian service
as to lead to the inevitable conclusion that
the only place for the most consecrated
Christians was the ministry. The great
need, in fact, is that there should be a vast
increase of voluntary workers; that the
<a name="png.102" id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>idea of “every Christian a missionary”
should permeate the whole Church, both
at home and abroad. We have seen
recently that wonderful results can flow
when this ideal dominates the Church, as
in the history of the last ten years in
Korea.</p>

<p>Now Friends have a position of peculiar
strength in this matter and one which in
England has been nobly used, especially
through the Adult School movement.</p>

<p>I am not here to say that the practice
of Friends needs no modification, in view
of the special circumstances either of missionary
work abroad or of the conditions
of a new country like this; but I do most
emphatically believe that Friends have here
a great testimony and one which is needed
by the whole Christian Church.</p>

<p>I am not maintaining that there is no
place for the supported minister. You in
America have found for him a larger place,
in the special conditions of your life, than
we have among Friends in England; but,
even here, I am persuaded that you recognize
to the full the primary thought that a
<a name="png.103" id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>man is not paid for his services or in proportion
thereto, but that he is simply
maintained in order that he may fulfil
the ministry which has been entrusted
to him.</p>

<p>Is there not also great value in the insistence
upon the fact that the ministry of
the Church is not dependent upon the laying
on of hands, or any other outward
ceremony? I should like to quote again
from the West China document to which
I have already referred, under the heading
of “Ministry.”</p>

<p>“1. The supreme and only indispensable
qualification for the Christian ministry is
the Divine call, habitually responded to.
Any man or woman so used of God is thereby
constituted a Christian minister.</p>

<p>“2. The part of the Church is to recognize
such ministers.”</p>

<p>It is not only the mere fact of his salary
which makes the workingman shun the
parson. It is the thought of a class set
apart, different from the ordinary man in
the street. Are we making full use of the
advantage we possess through having our
<a name="png.104" id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>business men engaged in the active ministry
of the Church? If we have broken down
the barrier between lay and cleric, have
we not at the same time done something to
remove the barrier between labor and the
Church?</p>

<p><em>The Church, then, needs to be reminded
perpetually that the ministry is not the work
of a class but of all, and that the service of
Christ is not a profession but a free-will
offering.</em></p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>There is one other direction in which my
own experience leads me to believe that
Friends have a position of peculiar advantage
and responsibility, and I cannot close
this address without making some reference
thereto. We are all well aware of the great
difficulties which have been faced and are
still being faced by the Church of Christ
to-day through the advent of the historical
criticism of the Bible. On the one hand
there are those who believe that the Bible
should be treated exactly as any other
book; that the various documents which
<a name="png.105" id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have been embodied in it should be critically
examined and that every statement should
be checked and challenged. This treatment
of the Bible has led to results which
many regard as serious, if not disastrous.
So much is this the case that many of the
most earnest followers of Christ believe
on the other hand that the whole movement,
generally spoken of as the “higher criticism,”
is altogether evil and to be resisted
with the whole strength of the Church.
This school, with which are associated
some of the most saintly and earnest
Christian workers, believes that we should
maintain the entire literal inspiration of
the whole of Holy Scripture. From the
results which they have seen in the case
of many who have been grievously upset,
and whose faith seems to have been shipwrecked
through following the higher critics,
they have come to the conclusion that it is
wrong to allow any question to be asked
which might lead to the shaking of our
faith in the literal accuracy of the whole
book. To some it seems as though these
two schools of thought could not possibly
<a name="png.106" id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be reconciled. They regard their opponents
as hopelessly narrow-minded and bigoted
or as giving away the very essence of Christian
faith. But can the Christian Church
afford to lose either section? It is true
there may be irreconcilable extremists on
both sides; but even this I should be sorry
to admit. Of course, there are some who
have entered upon the critical study of
the Bible from a sceptical standpoint:
I am not referring to these. But there are
many who are truly devout scholars and
who are intensely loyal to our Lord Jesus
Christ; and there are many younger men
and women who long to be able to maintain
the faith delivered to their fathers, but who
feel that, in doing so, they dare not be untrue
to their own God-given reason, and who
are therefore compelled to face the questions
which some would counsel them to leave
alone. The cure for such is not to tell
them that an unorthodox view with regard
to the authority of a certain book puts them
outside the Kingdom of God: unfortunately
there are not a few whose counsels to the
young would seem to point in this direction.
<a name="png.107" id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Can we not find a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i> which
will help us to work together in love in
spite of the fact that we differ so greatly
even on so important a question? If we
cannot so work together I believe there
must be weakness in our testimony to Christ.</p>

<p>I think that the Society of Friends is
in a position of unique strength in regard
to this difficult problem. The early Friends
realized—as their contemporaries did not—that
the Holy Scriptures contained the
word of God; but that it was not right to
speak of them as being the word of God.
They realized the danger, to which the
Reformers were many of them blind, of
a literalism in the interpretation of Scripture
which would bind men as did the tradition
of the Elders in the time of Christ.
Nevertheless, they held with tremendous
tenacity the view that the Scriptures were
indeed inspired of God, and this none the
less because the same Spirit who first
inspired men of old to write was present
and necessary to help the men of to-day in
the interpretation of those writings.<!-- TN: period invisible --> This
view is thus expressed by Samuel Fisher:</p>

<p><a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“And because we do not, with the misty
ministers of the mere letter, own the bare
text of Scripture entire in every tittle, but
say it hath suffered much loss of more
than vowels, single letters and single lines
also, yea, even of whole epistles and prophecies
of inspired men, the copies of which
are not by the clergy canonized nor by
the Bible sellers bound up, and especially
because we own not the said alterable
and much altered outward text, but the
holy truth and inward light and spirit
to be the Word of God, which is living
[and] the true touchstone, therefore they
cry out against us. Yet the Scriptures
are owned by us in their due place and
the letter is acknowledged by us full as
much as it is by itself, to have been written
by men moved of God’s Spirit.”<a name="fn8" id="fn8"></a><a title="Go to footnote 8"
 href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>This, it seems to me, is the platform upon
which all reverent scholars and devout
lovers of the Bible can meet. The Society
of Friends, which has ever stood for tolerance,
is not the Body to hurl anathemas at
those who are finding light for their path
<a name="png.109" id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in ways that to some of us may seem dark
and tortuous. Rather, is it not the Body
which, in the true spirit of its founders,
may bring us together with a tendering of
spirit, as we own allegiance to one common
Lord and as we recognize together the far
greater dangers that confront the Church
in the sin and unbelief of the world in which
we live.</p>

<p><em>The Church needs to recognize that even
large divergence of view in reference to the
Bible is consistent with loyalty to Christ,
and that we must all stand together to face
the great tasks that demand her undivided
attention.</em></p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>In conclusion, let me say a few words
upon the meaning of all this to ourselves.
Much that I have said to you will be
familiar, and perhaps even of the nature of
platitudes to many of you; but it is worth
saying if it does no more than bring us all
to the same point for facing the tasks that
are before us to-day. We come to this
point recognizing that, whether at home
<a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or abroad, the Society of Friends is called
to play a part, to make a contribution of
permanent worth to the Church of Christ.
I have touched upon some of the things
that are included in the heritage of the past.
In our Books of Discipline, in the memoirs
of ancient Friends, in the lives of our own
parents and grandparents we have abundant
proof of our goodly spiritual inheritance;
and the amazing fact that confronts
us to-day is surely this—that, having so
much, we are giving so little. The really
pressing question is not, “What is our
contribution?” but, “How are we to make
it?” What a glorious heritage the Jews
possessed when our Lord was on earth,
and yet how many of them were content
to say “We have Abraham to our father!”
We need, then, first a new conviction—a
conviction that what God has given to
us is not only beautiful, uplifting and
inspiring, but that it is true. Whence
can this conviction come? It can come to
us only from God Himself. The records
of the past, however luminous, will not
enlighten us without His Spirit. We need
<a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to be brought into His presence, that we
may see Him, as did our fathers, and have
that note of conviction in all that we say
and do that shall compel men to believe
that what we say is true.</p>

<p>And, secondly, we need a new consecration.
To us there may be revealed “the
vision beautiful”; but only when we have
said with the whole heart, “Here am I,
send me,” can we be trusted to bring that
vision into the lives of others. If we are
mere imitators of others, the ideal may
seem beautiful, but it is not compelling
enough for us to take up the cross and go
all lengths in the service of the Master.
When we draw our inspiration from Him
direct, there comes into our lives that
intensely personal motive which the Apostle
described in the words “The love of Christ
constraineth us.” In this spirit of consecration
to Him we shall be united with
one another, and, being thus joined together,
we shall be permitted to bring our message
home to others as we could in no other way.</p>

<p>And, thirdly, we need to have a larger
sympathy with those to whom we go.
<a name="png.112" id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It is not the passion of bigotry which will
enable us to deliver our message. Let us
remind ourselves again that we are one
with all who love the Lord in sincerity and
truth. If we expect others to understand
us, let us be at least as patient in seeking
to understand them. Let us beware of
the sectarian spirit. Let us emphasize
the fundamentals which we hold in common
with others even more than our own
distinctive views. The more we have to
give, the more vital does it become that
we should “walk humbly with our God.”
The spiritual pride which writes off the
achievements of our ancestors on the credit
side of our own balance sheet is perhaps
one of the chief hindrances to our paying
the debt which we owe to the Church.</p>

<p>And, fourthly, we need a corporate
sense of our mission and message. If
only each of us in this great representative
gathering might be given afresh the child-like
spirit, and if all together we might
hear once more the call of the Master ring
out clear and strong to our Society, might
not even the early triumphs of Quakerism
<a name="png.113" id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be surpassed? A new age needs indeed a
new spirit. We are not called to give just
the same thing as was given by our spiritual
forefathers; but we are called each and all
to give our best, without stint, without
counting the cost, and, unless we do, we
cannot be true to that which God has
given us.</p>

<p>Out of the dedicated spirit of the body
as a whole there will be born a race of
apostles. To each is given his ministry—“To
some apostles.” We must have such
if our message is to ring forth with its
ancient power and in new and living tones.
It should be the peculiar task of the Society
of Friends to raise up apostles. We need
to travail in pain till they be born, and the
pain is to be the long sorrow of a world’s
need which God has given us the ability
to meet, and which for Christ’s sake we will
make our own.</p>

<p>When I think of these great needs around
me, I can sometimes feel that the illusion
lifts and “the <em>truth</em> lies bare.” In the
Church and beyond its borders I seem
to hear the yearning cry of those who aspire
<a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and whose aspirations are checked and
thwarted: the bitter murmurings of those
who have lost their confidence in organized
Christianity and have been soured and
alienated where they should have found
sympathy and help: the warring and discordant
notes of those who quarrel and
misunderstand each other where they should
unite firmly to represent Christ to the world:
the perplexed questionings of those who
seek to steer a straight course through the
maze of modern life, and who have no certain
guide: the weary sigh of those for whom
life is too rapid and who have no time to
turn inward and find their peace in Christ:
the almost stifled sob of the souls that are
cramped by the pressure of a materialistic
view of life, or by the crushing weight of
a world that leaves out God.</p>

<p>The call comes from far and near for
sympathy, deliverance, direction, peace and
courage. Through it all may we not catch
the tones of One whose heart still beats
with the heart of his weakest child, saying</p>
